# mas-345
Example python code for interfacing a MAS-345 digital multimeter over RS-232

As the MASVIEW V1.1 software (Win95/98) does not run on a recent Windows OS anymore, I needed to find some other way for interfacing with my MAS-345 digital multimeter. Serial port setup is 600,7N2, no handshaking, with RTS disabled and DTR enabled.
